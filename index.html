  <h1>Hello & Welcome,<br> To Stephen Sawyer's FEWD Portfolio</h1>

  <p>Interestingly enough, General Assembly's Front End course was never an option on my radar after applying here.<br> In fact I was gunning to get a seat for their 12 week Web Immersive, however no matter how hard I tried to study on my own, <br> I could never truly master the JavaScript that was neccessary for the entrance exam. So finally after months of experimenting and communication I was recommended the FEWD course. And because of it I'm learning more than i ever could've discovered on my own</p>
