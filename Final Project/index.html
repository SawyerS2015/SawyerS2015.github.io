<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<h3>So pretty much...</h3>
<p>The concept of my project would be about displaying every month long observance in american culture, as well as a short biogrophy of someone who fits into the category of that observance.<br><br>For example, "Latin American History Month" is a month long observance and it begins in September. So I would want the page to display all of the months in an interactive way so that when September is clicked the user not only learns that this is Latin American History Month; but also of a more obscure representative for that said month (hence the biography)</p>

<p>I decided to go with this idea because when I applied to GA my website had a political theme to it, and personally I prefer it when my projects have a theme or a message behind it.<br> Also I believe in an interview where Morgan Freeman gave his opinion on Black History he asked "Why should black history only be delegated to one month" or in other words why should we have to wait until February to recognize black history. I agree with his sentament, and honestly I think we could all learn a lot by recognizing different cultures on a regular basis rather than a yearly one.</p>

<p>Down below are a list of links that will help me in terms of my research<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Month-long_observances">Wikipedia</a><br><br><a href="https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/education-outreach/CALENDAR-OF-OBSERVANCES-2016.pdf">Anti Defamation League</a></p>
